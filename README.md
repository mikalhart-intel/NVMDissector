Example C# application to ring an Android phone using the REST API

.. code-block:: csharp

Copy code
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace RingAndroidPhone
{
    class Program
    {
        // Replace the following values with your own.
        private static string androidId = "YOUR_ANDROID_ID";
        private static string accessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                RingPhone().Wait();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }

        static async Task RingPhone()
        {
            // Set up the HTTP request.
            var client = new HttpClient();
            var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post,
                $"https://www.googleapis.com/android/find/ring?androidId={androidId}&access_token={accessToken}");

            // Send the request and get the response.
            var response = await client.SendAsync(request);

            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Phone is ringing!");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + response.ReasonPhrase);
            }
        }
    }
}
Where to find the androidId and accessToken values

The androidId value is a unique identifier for the Android device. It can be found by going to the device's settings and looking for the "Android ID" or "Device ID" value. The exact location may vary depending on the device and Android version.

The accessToken value is an OAuth 2.0 access token that is used to authenticate the request to the Google Android Device Manager API. It can be obtained by using the OAuth 2.0 flow for the Google Account associated with the device. This process typically involves creating a project in the Google Cloud Console, enabling the appropriate API, and using a library such as Google's OAuth 2.0 client library for .NET to handle the authentication flow.

Once the access token has been obtained, it can be used in the HTTP request to the Google Android Device Manager API to authenticate the request and authorize the operation. It should be treated as a sensitive value and handled with care, as it allows access to the device's information and capabilities.
